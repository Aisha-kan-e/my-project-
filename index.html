        Animal Exploitation

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        The exploitation of animals has been around forever whether it be in
        circuses, zoos or on Tv. Now days it seems to have taken a turn for the
        worst, youtube challenges and even inpulse gifts to throw away after
        holidays end, is sadly what animals are being used for today. A popular
        amusement park, sea world, has been breeding or taking orcas into
        captivity to use for their orca show where orcas are forced to be in a
        small pool of water for people's enjoyment.

        Why should we stop the exploitation of animals?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Aside from the orca's, many other animals are being used for youtube
        challenges and veiws. A youtube account that appeared to be rescuing
        animals in very bad condition, was found to have been purposely hurting
        the animals featured in their videos so that they could gain subscribers
        and veiws. when they were found out, they ended up deleting the account
        or changing it's name to avoid any reproccussions. Sadly it is unknown
        if that channel is still up and gaining support even though they're
        hurting animals. Every animal featured in said youtube channel knew that
        they were being treated unfairly.
